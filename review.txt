Frankly, I did not know anything about sails.js other than its name, but after going through
the tutorial I think I really like the framework(not really a framework though,
I would say a wrapper around the best existing technologies). If you have a good idea of
node express, socket.io, backbone, sails.js then making a basic chat application is a breeze.
I also liked the fact that it does not abstract away the underlying technologies used, we can
use them the way they are and not to mention its REST API creation. I am really looking 
forward to using it again.
Sockets are way better than ajax request if you ask me.

About the tutorial:
	I like net.tutsplus tutorials and this one wasn't any different. I refer the
website almost half of the time. Actually, I have found some mistakes in the
tutorial like

in the MainController.js file's signup function
it checks for usr variable in the condition which
will always be true even if its an empty array 
because !![] is true

and there are 3 more mistakes without which the application won't work 
but I have fixed them in the repo. Other than that I did some simple redesign
of the pages in a separate branch and merged it with master later.
